# EDX_Capstone
Final Submission for the Harvard EDX R Data science Course. 
Run Doall.r and system should replicate itself.  
Note that the knitr could program be problematic on some systems when run in batch.
Knit the rmd file from within Rstudio and it should work fine.
Data files should be used only for academic purposes.
